#1.Solved steady flow problem and steady heat conduction eqaution in a 2D plate using itterative schemes like gauss seidel and Alternating Direction Implicit, using Finite diffrence method. Ploted the resulting data to visulaize streamfunction and temprature contours.
#2.Solve a non-dimensional partial differential equation for Transient Couette Flow using finite difference method with specified boundary conditions for 1x101 grid size . Used pseudo-transient solution approach with initial condition of u-velocity as zero.Used diffrent  schemes like BTCS: Gauss-Seidel iterative method ,BTCS: Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm and Crank-Nicolson: Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm. Ploted flow profile at various time steps.
#3.Solved  Lid driven cavity problem using finite difference method for 100 x 100 grid size.Used Stream Vorticity approch with iterative gauss seidel scheme. ploted stream function, vorticity and velocity vectors in tecplot 360 using derived results and validated the solution against standard literature.
#4.Sloved Flow through suddenly contrcated channel using Stream Vorticity approch with iterative gauss seidel scheme.ploted stream function, vorticity and velocity vectors in tecplot360
#5.Developed C code to generate grid-based data points for visualizing flow profiles(aniomations and plots) for various problems, including flow through elliptical/triangular channels, pulsating flow, Stokesâ€™ problems, and Transient Couette flow.
